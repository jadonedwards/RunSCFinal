                </div>
        <p>Running with a group, both large or small, can be a very effective training tool. Having some running buddies can help increase your motivation (you’re less likely to bail on a run when you’re planning to meet people!), and it can make running a social experience. Studies show that runners who are part of a group or a club feel supported both during and outside of the run, and participants also report creating meaningful friendships within the larger running group.</p>
